# sicp-exercises
Exercises I've worked in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. 

TODO:
Continue reading the text and complete more exercises! There are also a number that
I hope to revisit within the near future to ensure correctness & perhaps find improved
solutions.

The nomenclature used for file names are inconsistent, I would like for them to more
directly reflect the exercise or exercises included within the file.

All programs written in MIT-Scheme.

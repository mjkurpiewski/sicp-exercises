Exercise 2.84: Using the raise operation of Exercise 2.83, modify the apply-generic procedure so that it coerces its arguments to have the same type by the method of successive raising, as discussed in this section. You will need to devise a way to test which of two types is higher in the tower. Do this in a manner that is “compatible” with the rest of the system and will not lead to problems in adding new levels to the tower.

This seems tricky. So, first of all, we need to write a procedure to test which 
of two (or more) arguments are higher in the tower. 

Well, how do we know what's higher or lower from the information in the program,
excluding our inherent knowledge of the tower being:
	  integer -> rational -> real -> complex
and without keying it to any real state of the program now, i.e., so that we can
add new types and find out.

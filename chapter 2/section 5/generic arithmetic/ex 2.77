In Exercise 2.77, we are asked why calling the operation magnitude on
a complex number defined as (define z (make-complex-from-real-imag 3 4))
returns an error saying that there is no method for magnitude on the type
(complex). This is because, as the exercise states, that there are no
entries in the operation table for magnitude, nor angle, imag-part, or real-part. As it stands, these were only defined for types 'rectangular or 'polar,
subsets of the complex package. 

By adding the given 4 lines to the complex package, magnitude now works. This
is because the operation is now defined on the complex numbers, so the
item, in this case (complex rectangular x . y), can now be parsed by apply-
generic.

The way this plays out is as such:
z = (complex rectangular 3 4)
(magnitude z)
(apply-generic 'magnitude z)
type-tags becomes 'complex
proc becomes (get 'magnitude 'complex)
proc is the generic magnitude function, defined as (apply-generic 'magnitude z)
so we (apply-generic 'magnitude (rectangular 3 . 4))
which returns as the procedure the rectangular magnitude function from the package
and then evaluate (3 . 4) from that procedure.
